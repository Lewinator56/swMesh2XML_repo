# FAQ

**A** Windows

**Q** I dont have a windows PC, can i still convert meshes?
**A** Sure, just head over [here](https://github.com/Lewinator56/swcpmc) to get the cross platform convereter. Ive not built it for linux or OSX yet, but it will run on mono or wine, of course, if you want, you can build it yourself, it only uses the standard cross-platform C libraries.

**A** No, I am however potentially working on a generic java version when I get time

# Getting Started
* Make sure you read the [User Guide](https://github.com/Lewinator56/swMesh2XML_repo/blob/master/swMesh2XML%20User%20Guide.pdf) and keep a copy of the [Error Guide](https://github.com/Lewinator56/swMesh2XML_repo/blob/master/Errors.md) to hand.
* A Tutorial for creating a basic mod is available [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4eOPBk_LjE&lc=UgwhD8fKLjYGQHiXdKp4AaABAg), bare in mind this only covered the absolute basics and does not cover multi-material meshes, functional blocks or multi-mesh blocks (such as lights and wheels), though the user guuide briefly explaines these. It also does not cover editing collisions, logic nodes or buoyancy or multi-paintable surfaces. 
* Any additional support can be obtained by DM'ing me on discord @Lewinator56#9325 or joining the [SMF discord server](https://discord.gg/9HS7cb6).
* If you are looking for the mod loader, this is the wrong place, you need its repo [here](https://github.com/Lewinator56/StormLoader).
